a|AQAvit (TM) is the quality and runtime branding evaluation project for Java SE runtimes and associated technology.  During a release it takes a functionally complete Java runtime and ensures that all the additional qualities are present that make it suitable for production use.  These quality criteria include good performance, exceptional security, resilience and endurance, and the ability to pass a wide variety of application test suites.  In addition to verifying that functionally complete runtimes are release ready, the AQA tests may also serve to verify new functionality during runtime development.

== The AQAvit Name

The AQAvit project gets its name from Adoptium Quality Assurance ‘AQA’ and ‘vit’ for vitality and speed. As the project engages with vendors and enterprise consumers, the test suite is expanded and improved to keep pace with the latest Java releases and to continuously raise the quality bar through collaboration and rigour.  

== AQAvit Project Central

As listed in the https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium.aqavit/developer[Developer Resources^] section of the Eclipse Foundation https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium.aqavit[AQAvit project^] page, AQAvit is comprised of many repositories.  The central one is the https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests[aqa-tests^] repository which houses the project's test definition files, much of the project's documentation and is the base for running the AQAvit test suite.  To participate in the project, people are invited to join the https://adoptium.net/slack.html[Adoptium Slack workspace^] and ask questions in the `#testing-aqavit` channel.

== AQAvit Verification

The AQAvit project was created to “make quality certain to happen.” AQAvit verification is achieved through the process of running and passing a prescribed and versioned set of tests in the AQAvit test suite. As per the Eclipse Foundation Quality Verification Software License (QVSL) section 5b, a distributor who wants to certify their distributions then shares a summary of the test results by which verification was achieved.

AQAvit verification is one of the criteria for listing in the link:/marketplace[Adoptium Marketplace]. Leveraging the AQAvit test suite to ensure the quality of the binaries listed in the Adoptium Marketplace not only communicates to consumers how serious we are about quality, but also consolidates the good verification practices of the Adoptium Working Group members under a centralized effort. AQAvit aligns its test suite standards with the ever-changing requirements of the user base.
